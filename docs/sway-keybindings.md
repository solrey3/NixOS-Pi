## Trackpad

Sway is configured to behave more like COSMIC/Plasma:

- tap-to-click
- 2-finger tap for right click
- 3-finger tap for middle click
- tap-and-drag
- clickfinger right/middle click
- traditional two-finger scrolling
- taps stay enabled immediately after typing
- click-to-focus instead of focus-follows-mouse
- 3-finger left/right swipes switch workspaces
- 3-finger up opens the launcher
- 3-finger down shows the scratchpad

## Status, power, and display

Waybar replaces swaybar and shows workspaces, network, Bluetooth, audio, power profile, battery, and a clock. Clicking the power-profile module cycles through power-saver, balanced, and performance. Laptops automatically use balanced on AC and power-saver on battery.

Idle handling dims after 5 minutes, locks after 10, powers displays off after 15, and suspends after 30. On Quebec, idle suspend is skipped while connected to AC so MPD can continue playing; locking and display power-off still apply.

The built-in `eDP-1` panel uses native `2880x1920@120Hz` with `scale 1.75`, giving an approximately `1646x1097` logical workspace. GTK/GDK applications inherit this fractional scale from Wayland/Sway. Quebec also receives the repository-managed Wall-11-inspired wallpaper in Sway and Plasma and uses it on the lock screen. Other hosts use the `air-23` wallpaper.

## Config location

The generated Sway config is managed in:

```text
modules/home/budchris/sway.nix
```

It reads Sway's default config and replaces the default terminal with Ghostty, replaces the click-based logout prompt with a keyboard confirmation mode, adds trackpad, laptop-key, power, idle, and lock behavior, and swaps swaybar for Waybar.
